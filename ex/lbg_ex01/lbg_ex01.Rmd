This questionnaire helps me to assess your experience with programming and data analysis. It is not a test and it will not be graded. Please, answer the following question. Thank you very much for your collaboration. 


## Question 1
What programming languages do you know? For each programming language you know, please indicate the level of your knowledge with the labels _professional_ (p), _intermediate_ (m) and _beginner_ (b).


### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->


## Question 2
Have you made any experiences with programming languages such as R in previous courses or projects?

### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->


## Question 3
What tools do you use when you have to work with data during your internships/practicals or during your Bachelor or Master thesis?

### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->



## Question 4
Are you interested in learning how to program? Please rate the level of your interest with the labels _very high_, _rather high_, _low_ and _very low_. 

### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->



## Question 5
What is the meaning of the following terms: 

* Genotypefrequency: 
* Allelefrequency:
* Breeding value:
* Additive genetic variance:



## Question 6
How many different vectors do you see in the following picture?

```{r vector-physics-perspective, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/vector-physics-perspective.odg", ps_rmd_src = s_this_rmd_file)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/vector-physics-perspective.png")
```



## Question 7
What is a matrix?

### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->



## Question 8
Please convert the following system of linear equations into matrix-vector notation

\begin{align}
 x_1 +  x_2 &= 2 \notag \\
 x_1 -  x_2 &= 1 \notag \\
 x_1        &= 4 \notag
(\#eq:intro-linalg-first-example)
\end{align}



## Question 9
How do you assign the vector $v = \left[\begin{array}{c}10 \\ 15 \\ 21 \end{array} \right]$ to the variable named `vec` in R?

### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->



## Question 10
How do you assign the matrix $M = \left[\begin{array}{cc}1 & 2 \\ 3  &  4 \\ 5  & 6 \end{array} \right]$ to the variable named `mat` in R?

## Question 11
Let us assume, we have some data in a file called `data.csv`. The format of the data is in `comma separated values` (csv). How do you read the data from the file and assign it to the variable named `datadf` in R?

### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->



## Question 12
We have measurements of body weight and height of dairy cows. What is the statistical approach that you can use to see whether the `height` of the cow is related to its `body weight`? What is the technique that you can use to estimate the strength of the relationship between the two variables `height` and `body weight`?

### Your Answer <!-- Please specify your answer, starting on the next line-->



## Question 13
Do you have any experience in writing RMarkdown documents? If yes, for what type of document (reports, Bachelor thesis, others, ...) did you use RMarkdown?
