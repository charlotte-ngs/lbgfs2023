```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
# rmdhelp::show_knit_hook_call()
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmdhelp::hook_convert_odg)
```

## Decomposition

* For animal $i$ with parents $s$ and $d$, breeding value $u_i$ can be decomposed 

$$u_i = {1\over 2}u_s + {1\over 2}u_d + m_i$$
 
* Modelling $m_i$ as deviation leads to 

$${1\over N}\sum_{k=1}^N m_k = 0$$

for a large number of offspring of the same parents.
 
## Verify
 
* Single locus model with locus $G$
* Locus $G$ is bi-allelic
* Allele frequencies $p$ and $q$ and genotypic values $a$ and $d$ are known
* Different cases according to genotypes of parents and offspring


## Homozygous Parents

```{r homozygous-parents, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="100%"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/homozygous-parents.odg", ps_odg_template = "odg_draw_a4_landscape")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/homozygous-parents.png")
```

  
## Further Cases

* Mixed homozygous / heterozygous parents
* Heterozygous parents
