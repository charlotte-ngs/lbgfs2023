# Basics in Quantitative Genetics {#quan-gen}
```{r met-intro-qg-reset, echo=FALSE}
s_this_rmd_file <- rmdhelp::get_this_rmd_file()
met$set_this_rmd_file(ps_this_rmd_file = s_this_rmd_file)
```

As already mentioned in section \@ref(geno-pheno), the central dogma of molecular biology tells us that the genotype is the basics of any phenotypic expression. The genotype of an individual is composed of a number of genes which are also called __loci__. In this section, we start with the simplest possible genetic architecture where the genotype is composed by just one locus. The connection between the genotype and the phenotype is modeled according to equation \@ref(eq:phengenenv). The phenotype is assumed to be a quantitative trait. That means we are not looking at binary or categorical traits. Categorical traits can just take a limited number of different levels. Examples of categorical traits are the horn status in cattle or certain color characteristics. Quantitative traits do not take discrete levels but they show specific distributions. 


## Single Locus - Quantitative Trait {#single-locus-quant-trait}
In Livestock there are not many examples where a quantitative trait is influenced by just one locus. But this case helps in understanding the foundation of more complex genetic architectures. We start by looking at the following idealized population (Figure \@ref(fig:idealpopsingletrait)). 

```{r idealpopsingletrait, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.cap="Idealized Population With A Single Locus", out.width='100%'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/idealpopsingletrait.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/idealpopsingletrait.png")
```


### Terminology {#qg-terminology}
The different genetic variants that are present at our Locus $G$ are called __alleles__. When looking at all individuals in the population for our locus, we have two different alleles $G_1$ and $G_2$. Hence, we call the locus $G$ to be a __bi-allelic__ locus. In any given individual of the population, the two alleles of the locus $G$ together are called the individuals __genotype__. All possible combinations of the two alleles at the locus $G$ leads to a total number of three genotypes. It is important to mention that the order of the alleles in a given genotype is not important. Hence, $G_1G_2$ and $G_2G_1$ are the same genotype. The two genotypes $G_1G_1$ and $G_2G_2$ are called __homozygous__ and the genotype $G_1G_2$ is called __heterozygous__. 


## Frequencies {#qg-frequency}
To be able to characterize our population with respect to the locus of interest, we are first looking at some frequencies. These are measures of how often a certain allele or genotype does occur in our population. For our example population shown in Figure \@ref(fig:idealpopsingletrait), the __genotype frequencies__ are

\begin{align}
f(G_1G_1) &= \frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \notag \\
f(G_1G_2) &= \frac{3}{10} = 0.3 \notag \\
f(G_2G_2) &= \frac{3}{10} = 0.3  (\#eq:genotypefreq)
\end{align}

The __allele frequencies__ can be determined either by counting or they can be computed from the genotype frequencies.

\begin{align}
f(G_1) &= f(G_1G_1) + {1\over 2}*f(G_1G_2) = 0.55 \notag \\
f(G_2) &= f(G_2G_2) + {1\over 2}*f(G_1G_2) = 0.45 (\#eq:allelefreq)
\end{align}


## Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium {#hw-eq}
The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is the central law of how allele frequencies and genotype frequencies are related in an idealized population. Given the allele frequencies 

\begin{align}
f(G_1) &= p \notag \\
f(G_2) &= q = 1-p
(\#eq:allelefreq)
\end{align}

During mating, we assume that in an idealized population alleles are combined independently. This leads to the genotype frequencies shown in Table \@ref(tab:tabgenfreq).

```{r tabgenfreq, echo=FALSE}
df_genfreq <- data.frame(Alleles = c("$G_1$", "$G_2$"),
                         G1 = c("$f(G_1G_1) = p^2$", "$f(G_1G_2) = p*q$"),
                         G2 = c("$f(G_1G_2) = p*q$", "$f(G_2G_2) = q^2$")) 
names(df_genfreq) <- c("Alleles", "$G_1$", "$G_2$")
knitr::kable(df_genfreq,
             format   = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), 'latex', 'html'),
             booktabs = TRUE,
             caption  = "Genotype Frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium",
             align    = "c",
             escape   = FALSE
)
```

Summing up the heterozygous frequencies leads to 

\begin{align}
f(G_1G_1) &= p^2 \notag \\
f(G_1G_2) &= 2pq \notag \\
f(G_2G_2) &= q^2
(\#eq:genofreq)
\end{align}

Comparing these expected genotype frequencies in a idealized population under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to what we found for the small example population in Figure \@ref(fig:idealpopsingletrait), we can clearly say that the small example population is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.


## Value and Mean {#value-mean}
Our goal is still to improve our population at the genetic level. The term improvement implies the need for a quantitative assessment of our trait of interest. Furthermore, we have to be able to associate the genotypes in the population to the quantitative values of our trait. 


### Genotypic Values {#geno-value}
The values $V_{ij}$ to each genotype $G_iG_j$ are assigned as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:genotypicvalue). 

```{r genotypicvalue, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.cap="Genotypic Values", out.width="100%"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/genotypicvalue.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/genotypicvalue.png")
```

The origin of the genotypic values is placed in the middle between the two homozygous genotypes $G_2G_2$ and $G_1G_1$. Here we are assuming that $G_1$ is the favorable allele. This leads to values of $+a$ for genotype $G_1G_1$ and of $-a$ for genotype $G_2G_2$. The value of genotype $G_1G_2$ is set to $d$ and is called dominance deviation. Table \@ref(tab:tabsumgenvalue) summarizes the values for all genotypes.

```{r tabsumgenvalue, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  data.frame(Variable = c("$V_{11}$", "$V_{12}$", "$V_{22}$"),
             Genotype = c("$G_1G_1$", "$G_1G_2$", "$G_2G_2$"),
             Values   = c("a", "d", "-a")),
  format   = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), 'latex', 'html'),
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = "Values for all Genotypes",
  align = "c",
  escape = FALSE
)
```


### Population Mean {#pop-mean}
For the complete population, we can compute the __population mean__ ($\mu$) of all values at the locus $G$. This mean corresponds to the expected value and is computed as 

\begin{align}
\mu &= V_{11} * f(G_1G_1) + V_{12} * f(G_1G_2) + V_{22} * f(G_2G_2) \notag \\
    &= a * p^2 + d *2pq + (-a) * q^2 \notag \\
    &= (p-q)a + 2pqd
(\#eq:popmean)
\end{align}
 
The population mean depends on the values $a$ and $d$ and on the allele frequencies $p$ and $q$. The larger the difference between $p$ and $q$ the more influence the value $a$ has in $\mu$, because for very different $p$ and $q$ the product $2pq$ is very small. On the other hand, if $p=q=0.5$, then $\mu = 0.5d$. For loci with $d=0$, the population mean $\mu = (p-q)a$ and hence, if in addition we have $p=q$, then $\mu=0$. 


### Breeding Values {#breed-value}
The term __breeding value__ is defined as shown in Definition \@ref(def:defbreedingvalue).


<!-- ```{definition, name = "Breeding Value", label="defbreedingvalue"} -->
<!-- The breeding value of an animal $i$ is defined as two times the difference between the mean value of offsprings of animal $i$ and the population mean. -->
<!-- ``` -->

Applying this definition and using the parameters that we have computed so far leads to the following formulas for the breeding value of an animal with a certain genotype. 


#### Breeding value for $G_1G_1$
Assume that we have a given parent $S$ with a genotype $G_1G_1$ and we want to compute its breeding value. Let us further suppose that our single parent $S$ is mated to a potentially infinite number of animals from the idealized population, then we can deduce the following mean genotypic value for the offspring of parent $S$. 

\vspace{5ex}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Mates of $S$} \\
\hline
& $f(G_1) = p$       &  $f(G_2) = q$   \\
\hline
Parent $S$       &                    &                 \\
\hline
$f(G_1) = 1$ &  $f(G_1G_1) = p$   &  $f(G_1G_2) = q$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{5ex}

Because parent $S$ has genotype $G_1G_1$, the frequency $f(G_1)$ of a $G_1$ allele coming from $S$ is $1$ and the frequency $f(G_2)$ of a $G_2$ allele is 0. The expected genetic value ($\mu_{11}$) of the offspring of animal $S$ can be computed as

\begin{equation}
\mu_{11} = p*a + q*d
(\#eq:MeanOffGen11)
\end{equation}

Applying definition \@ref(def:defbreedingvalue), we can compute the breeding value ($BV_{11}$) for animal $S$ as shown in equation \@ref(eq:BVGen11) while using the results given by equations \@ref(eq:MeanOffGen11) and \@ref(eq:popmean).

\begin{align}
BV_{11} &=  2*(\mu_{11} - \mu)  \notag \\
        &=  2\left(pa + qd - \left[(p - q)a + 2pqd \right] \right) \notag\\
        &=  2\left(pa + qd - (p - q)a - 2pqd \right) \notag\\
        &=  2\left(qd + qa - 2pqd\right) \notag \\
        &=  2\left(qa + qd(1 - 2p)\right) \notag \\
        &=  2q\left(a + d(1 - 2p)\right) \notag \\
        &=  2q\left(a + (q-p)d\right)
(\#eq:BVGen11)
\end{align}


Breeding values for parents with genotypes $G_2G_2$ and $G_1G_2$ are derived analogously.

#### Breeding value for $G_2G_2$
First, we determine the expected genotypic value for offsprings of a parent $S$ with genotype $G_2G_2$

\vspace{5ex}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Mates of parent $S$} \\
\hline
& $f(G_1) = p$       &  $f(G_2) = q$   \\
\hline
Parent $S$       &                    &                 \\
\hline
$f(G_2) = 1$ &  $f(G_1G_2) = p$   &  $f(G_2G_2) = q$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{5ex}

The expected genetic value ($\mu_{22}$) of the offspring of animal $S$ can be computed as

\begin{equation}
\mu_{22} = pd - qa
(\#eq:MeanOffGen22)
\end{equation}

The breeding value $BV_{22}$ corresponds to

\begin{align}
BV_{22} &=   2*(\mu_{22} - \mu)  \notag \\
        &=   2\left(pd - qa - \left[(p - q)a + 2pqd \right] \right) \notag \\
        &=   2\left(pd - qa - (p - q)a - 2pqd \right) \notag \\
        &=   2\left(pd - pa - 2pqd\right) \notag \\
        &=   2\left(-pa + p(1-2q)d\right) \notag \\
        &=  -2p\left(a + (q - p)d\right)
(\#eq:BVGen22)
\end{align}


#### Breeding value for $G_1G_2$
The genotype frequencies of the offsprings of a parent $S$ with a genotype $G_1G_2$ is determined in the following table.

\vspace{5ex}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Mates of parent $S$} \\
\hline
& $f(G_1) = p$       &  $f(G_2) = q$   \\
\hline
Parent $S$       &                    &                 \\
\hline
$f(G_1) = 0.5$ &  $f(G_1G_1) = 0.5p$   &  $f(G_1G_2) = 0.5q$\\
\hline
$f(G_2) = 0.5$ &  $f(G_1G_2) = 0.5p$   &  $f(G_2G_2) = 0.5q$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{5ex}

The expected mean genotypic value of the offsprings of parent $S$ with genotype $G_1G_2$ is computed as

\begin{equation}
\mu_{12} = 0.5pa + 0.5d - 0.5qa = 0.5\left[(p-q)a + d \right]
(\#eq:MeanOffGen12)
\end{equation}

The breeding value $BV_{12}$ corresponds to 

\begin{align}
BV_{12} &=   2*(\mu_{12} - \mu) \notag \\
        &=   2\left(0.5(p-q)a + 0.5d - \left[(p - q)a + 2pqd \right] \right) \notag \\
        &=   2\left(0.5pa - 0.5qa + 0.5d - pa + qa - 2pqd \right) \notag \\
        &=   2\left(0.5(q-p)a + (0.5 - 2pq)d \right) \notag \\
        &=   (q-p)a + (1-4pq)d  \notag \\
        &=   (q-p)a + (p^2 + 2pq + q^2 -4pq)d  \notag \\
        &=   (q-p)a + (p^2 - 2pq + q^2)d  \notag \\
        &=   (q-p)a + (q - p)^2d   \notag \\
        &=   (q-p)\left[a + (q-p)d \right]
(\#eq:BVGen12)
\end{align}

#### Summary of Breeding Values
The term $a + (q-p)d$ appears in all three breeding values. We replace this term by $\alpha$ and summarize the results in the following table.

\vspace{5ex}

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  Genotype  &  Breeding Value\\
  \hline
  $G_1G_1$  &  $2q\alpha$    \\
  \hline
  $G_1G_2$  &  $(q-p)\alpha$ \\
  \hline
  $G_2G_2$  &  $-2p\alpha$   \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{5ex}

### Allele Substitution {#allele-substitution}
Comparing the genotype $G_2G_2$ with the genotype $G_1G2$, one of the differences is in the number of $G_1$-alleles. $G_2G_2$ has zero $G_1$-alleles and $G_1G_2$ has one $G_1$-allele. 

Let us imagine that we take animal $i$ with a $G_2G_2$ genotype and use the CRISPR-CAS genome editing technology to replace one of the $G_2$ alleles in animal $i$ by a $G_1$ allele (see Figure \@ref(fig:genome-editing-allele-substitution)). After applying the gene editing procedure to animal $i$ at locus $G$, animal $i$ would have genotype $G_1G_2$. 

```{r genome-editing-allele-substitution, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.cap="Schematic Depiction of Genome Editing on Animal i", out.width="100%"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/genome-editing-allele-substitution.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/genome-editing-allele-substitution.png")
```

Due to the application of genome editing at locus $G$ of animal $i$ the breeding value changed. Before the genome editing procedure it was $BV_{22}$ and after genome editing the breeding value of animal $i$ corresponds to $BV_{12}$. So the effect of replacing a $G_2$ allele by a $G_1$ allele on the breeding value corresponds to the difference $BV_{12} - BV_{22}$. The computation of this difference between the breeding value $BV_{12}$ and $B_{22}$ results in

\begin{align}
    BV{12} - BV_{22} &=   (q-p)\alpha - \left( -2p\alpha \right)  \notag \\
                      &=   (q-p)\alpha + 2p\alpha \notag \\
                      &=   (q-p+2p)\alpha \notag \\
                      &=   (q+p)\alpha \notag \\
                      &=   \alpha
  (\#eq:AdditiveBv1)
\end{align}

The analogous computation can be done by comparing the breeding values $BV_{11}$ and $BV_{12}$.

\begin{align}
    BV_{11} - BV_{12} & = & 2q\alpha - (q-p)\alpha \notag \\
                      & = & \left(2q - (q-p)\right)\alpha \notag\\
                      & = & \alpha 
  (\#eq:AdditiveBv2)
\end{align}

Because the differences between breeding values computed in \@ref(eq:AdditiveBv1) and \@ref(eq:AdditiveBv2) are equal, we can conclude that the breeding values show a linear dependence on the number of $G_1$ alleles. This is the reason why the breeding values are also called additive effects, because adding a further $G_1$ allele instead of a $G_2$ allel has always the same effect on the breeding values, namely just adding the constant allele substitution effect $\alpha$. 


### Dominance Deviation
When looking at the difference between the genotypic value $V_{ij}$ and the breeding value $BV_{ij}$ for each of the three genotypes, we get the following results.

  \begin{align}
  V_{11} - BV_{11} &=   a - 2q \alpha \notag \\
                   &=   a - 2q \left[ a + (q-p)d \right] \notag \\
                   &=   a - 2qa -2q(q-p)d \notag \\
                   &=   a(1-2q) - 2q^2d + 2pqd \notag \\
                   &=   \left[(p - q)a + 2pqd\right] - 2q^2d \notag \\
                   &=   \mu + D_{11} 
  \end{align}

  \begin{align}
  V_{12} - BV{12} &=   d - (q-p)\alpha \notag \\
                   &=   d - (q-p)\left[ a + (q-p)d \right] \notag \\
                   &=   \left[(p-q)a + 2pqd\right] + 2pqd \notag \\
                   &=   \mu + D_{12}
  \end{align}

  \begin{align}
  V_{22} - BV_{22} &=   -a - (-2p\alpha) \notag \\
                   &=   -a + 2p\left[ a + (q-p)d \right] \notag \\
                   &=   \left[(p-q)a + 2pqd\right] - 2p^2d \notag \\
                   &=   \mu + D_{22} \notag
  \end{align}

The difference all contain the population mean $\mu$ plus a certain deviation. This deviation term is called __dominance deviation__.


### Summary of Values
The following table summarizes all genotypic values all breeding values and the dominance deviations. 

\vspace{5ex}

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   Genotyp  &  genotypic value     &  Breeding Value    &  Dominance Deviation \\
   $G_iG_j$ &  $V_{ij}$            &  $BV_{ij}$         &  $D_{ij}$           \\
   \hline
   $G_1G_1$ &  $a$                 &  $2q\alpha$        &  $-2q^2d$          \\
   \hline
   $G_1G_2$ &  $d$                 &  $(q-p)\alpha$     & $2pqd$             \\
   \hline
   $G_2G_2$ &  $-a$                &  $-2p\alpha$       & $-2p^2d$           \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}    

\vspace{5ex}


The formulas in the above shown table assume that $G_1$ is the favorable allele with frequency $f(G_1) = p$. The allele frequency of $G_2$ is $f(G_2) = q$. Since we have a bi-allelic locus $p+q=1$.

Based on the definition of dominance deviation, the genotypic values $V_{ij}$ can be decomposed into the components population mean ($\mu$), breeding value ($BV_{ij}$) and dominance deviation ($D_{ij}$) according to equation \@ref(eq:SeparationGenoValue).

\begin{align}
V_{ij} &=   \mu + BV_{ij} + D_{ij}
(\#eq:SeparationGenoValue)
\end{align}


Taking expected values on both sides of equation \@ref(eq:SeparationGenoValue) and knowing that the population mean $\mu$ was defined as the expected value of the genotypic values in the population, i.e. $E\left[ V \right] = \mu$, it follows that the expected values of both the breeding values and the dominance deviations must be $0$. More formally, we have 

\begin{align}
E\left[ V \right] &=  E\left[ \mu + BV + D \right] \notag \\
                  &=  E\left[ \mu \right]  + E\left[ BV \right] + E\left[ D \right] \notag \\
                  &=  \mu
(\#eq:ExpValueGenBvDom)
\end{align}

From the last line in equation \@ref(eq:ExpValueGenBvDom), it follows that $E\left[ BV \right] = E\left[ D \right] = 0$. This also shows that both breeding values and dominance deviations are defined as deviation from a given mean.


## Variances {#variances}
The population mean $\mu$ and derived from that the breeding values were defined as expected values. Their main purpose is to assess the state of a given population with respect to a certain genetic locus and its effect on a phenotypic trait of interest. One of our primary goals in livestock breeding is to improve the populations at the genetic level through the means of selection and mating. Selection of potential parents that produce offspring that are closer to our breeding goals is only possible, if the selection candidates show a certain level of variation in the traits that we are interested in. In populations where there is no variation which means that all individuals are exactly at the same level, it is not possible to select potential parents for the next generation. 

In statistics the measure that is most often used to assess variation in a certain population is called __variance__. For any given discrete random variable $X$ the variance is defined as the second central moment of $X$ which is computed as shown in equation \@ref(eq:VarianceDiscreteRV).

\begin{equation}
Var\left[X\right] = \sum_{x_i \in \mathcal{X}} (x_i - \mu_X)^2 * f(x_i)
(\#eq:VarianceDiscreteRV)
\end{equation}

 \vspace*{1ex}
  \begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{1cm}p{6cm}}
  where & $\mathcal{X}$: &  set of all possible $x$-values\\
        & $f(x_i)$       &  probability that $x$ assumes the value of $x_i$ \\
        & $\mu_X $       &  expected value $E\left[X\right]$ of $X$
  \end{tabular}
  
  
\vspace*{2ex}
In this section we will be focusing on separating the obtained variances into different components according to their causative sources. Applying the definition of variance given in equation  \@ref(eq:VarianceDiscreteRV) to the genotypic values $V_{ij}$, we obtain the following expression.

\begin{align}
\sigma_G^2 = Var\left[V\right] &=   (V_{11} - \mu)^2 * f(G_1G_1) \notag \\
                               &  +\  (V_{12} - \mu)^2 * f(G_1G_2) \notag \\
                               &  +\  (V_{22} - \mu)^2 * f(G_2G_2)
(\#eq:VarianceGenotypicValue)
\end{align}

where $\mu = (p - q)a + 2pqd$ the population mean.

Based on the decomposition of the genotypic value $V_{ij}$ given in \@ref(eq:SeparationGenoValue), the difference between $V_{ij}$ and $\mu$ can be written as the sum of the breeding value and the dominance deviation. Then $\sigma_G^2$ can be written as

\begin{align}
\sigma_G^2 = Var\left[V\right] &=   (BV_{11} + D_{11})^2 * f(G_1G_1) \notag \\
                               &  +\  (BV_{12} + D_{12})^2 * f(G_1G_2) \notag \\
                               &  +\  (BV_{22} + D_{22})^2 * f(G_2G_2)
(\#eq:GeneticVarianceBVDom)
\end{align}

Inserting the expressions for the breeding values $BV_{ij}$ and for the dominance deviation $D_{ij}$ found earlier and simplifying the equation leads to the result in \@ref(eq:FinalGeneticVariance). A more detailed derivation of $\sigma_G^2$ is given in the appendix (\@ref(appendix-derivations)) of this chapter.

\begin{align}
  \sigma_G^2 &=  2pq\alpha^2 + \left(2pqd \right)^2 \notag\\
             &=  \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_D^2
(\#eq:FinalGeneticVariance)             
\end{align}

The formula in equation \@ref(eq:FinalGeneticVariance) shows that $\sigma_G^2$ consists of two components. The first component $\sigma_A^2$ is called the __genetic additive variance__ and the second component $\sigma_D^2$ is termed __dominance variance__. As shown in equation \@ref(eq:VarBV) $\sigma_A^2$ corresponds to the variance of the breeding values. Because we have already seen that the breeding values are additive in the number of favorable alleles, $\sigma_A^2$ is called genetic additive variance. Because $\sigma_D^2$ corresponds to the variance of the dominance deviation effects (see equation \@ref(eq:VarDom)) it is called dominance variance.



## Appendix: Derivations {#appendix-derivations}
This section shows how the genetic variance in equation \@ref(eq:FinalGeneticVariance) is computed.

\begin{align}
\sigma_G^2  &=   (BV_{11} + D_{11})^2 * p^2                                       \notag \\
            &   +\  (BV_{12} + D_{12})^2 * 2pq                                    \notag \\
            &   +\  (BV_{22} + D_{22})^2 * q^2                                    \notag \\
            &=      \left(2q\alpha - 2q^2d   \right)^2 * p^2                      \notag \\
            &   +\  \left((q-p)\alpha + 2pqd \right)^2 * 2pq                      \notag \\
            &   +\  \left(-2p\alpha - 2p^2d  \right)^2 * q^2                      \notag \\
            &=      \left(4q^2\alpha^2 - 8q^3d\alpha + 4q^4d^2  \right) * p^2     \notag \\
            &   +\  \left(q^2\alpha^2 - 2pq\alpha^2 + p^2\alpha^2
                           - 4(q-p)pqd\alpha + 4p^2q^2d^2\right) * 2pq            \notag \\
            &   +\  \left(4p^2\alpha^2 + 8p^3d\alpha + 4p^4\alpha^2 \right) * q^2 \notag \\
            &=      4p^2q^2\alpha^2 - 8p^2q^3d\alpha + 4p^2q^4d^2                 \notag \\
            &   +\  2pq^3\alpha^2 - 4p^2q^2\alpha^2+ 2p^3q\alpha^2                \notag \\
            &   -\  8p^3q^2d\alpha + 8p^2q^3d\alpha + 8p^3q^3d^2                  \notag \\
            &   +\  4p^2q^2\alpha^2 + 8p^3q^2d\alpha + 4p^4q^2d^2                 \notag \\
            &=      4p^2q^2\alpha^2 + 4p^2q^4d^2                                  \notag \\
            &   +\  2pq^3\alpha^2 + 2p^3q\alpha^2                                 \notag \\
            &   +\  8p^3q^3d^2                                                    \notag \\
            &   +\  4p^4q^2d^2                                                    \notag \\
            &=      2pq\alpha^2 \left(p^2 + 2pq + q^2 \right)                     \notag \\
            &   +\  \left(2pqd \right)^2 \left(p^2 + 2pq + q^2 \right)            \notag \\
            &=      2pq\alpha^2 + \left(2pqd \right)^2                            \notag \\
            &=      \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_D^2
(\#eq:GenVarZWD)
\end{align}

From the last two lines of \@ref(eq:GenVarZWD) it follows that $\sigma_A^2 = 2pq\alpha^2$ and $\sigma_D^2 = \left(2pqd \right)^2$. It can be shown that $\sigma_A^2$ corresponds to the squared breeding values times the associated genotype frequencies. Because the expected values of the breeding values is zero, $\sigma_A^2$ is equivalent to the variance of the breeding values.

\begin{align}
\sigma_A^2 &= Var\left[ BV \right] = (BV_{11} - E\left[ BV \right])^2 * f(G_1G_1)  \notag \\
           &   + (BV_{12} - E\left[ BV \right])^2 * f(G_1G_2)  \notag \\
           &   + (BV_{22} - E\left[ BV \right])^2 * f(G_2G_2) \notag \\
           &= BV_{11}^2 * f(G_1G_1) + BV_{12}^2 * f(G_1G_2) + BV_{22}^2 * f(G_2G_2) \notag \\
           &= \left(2q \alpha \right)^2 * p^2 +  \left((q-p) \alpha \right)^2 * 2pq + \left(-2p \alpha \right)^2 * q^2 \notag \\
           &= 4p^2 q^2 \alpha^2 + \left(q^2 \alpha^2 -2pq\alpha^2 + p^2 \alpha^2 \right) * 2pq + 4p^2q^2\alpha^2 \notag \\
           &= 8p^2 q^2 \alpha^2 + 2pq^3\alpha^2 -4p^2q^2\alpha^2 + 2p^3q\alpha^2 \notag \\
           &= 4p^2 q^2 \alpha^2 + 2pq^3\alpha^2  + 2p^3q\alpha^2 \notag \\
           &= 2pq\alpha^2 \left(2pq + q^2 + p^2 \right) \notag \\
           &= 2pq\alpha^2
(\#eq:VarBV)
\end{align}

In the above derivation in \@ref(eq:VarBV) of the variance of the breeding values, we were using the fact that the expected value $E\left[ BV \right]=0$. This can be shown more formally as follows

\begin{align}
E\left[ BV \right]  &=  BV_{11} * f(G_1G_1) + BV_{12} * f(G_1G_2)  + BV_{22} * f(G_2G_2) \notag \\
                    &=  2q \alpha * p^2 + (q-p) \alpha * 2pq + (-2p \alpha) * q^2 \notag \\
                    &=  2p^2q \alpha + 2pq^2 \alpha - 2p^2q\alpha - 2pq^2\alpha \notag \\
                    &=  0
(\#eq:ExpectedValueBV)
\end{align}

Similarly to \@ref(eq:VarBV) we can show that $\sigma_D^2$ corresponds to the squared dominance deviations times the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes. That is the reason why $\sigma_D^2$ is called dominance variance.

\begin{align}
\sigma_D^2  &=  D_{11}^2 * f(G_1G_1) + D_{12}^2 * f(G_1G_2) + D_{22}^2 * f(G_2G_2) \notag \\
            &=   (- 2q^2d)^2 * p^2 + (2pqd)^2 * 2pq + (- 2p^2d)^2 * q^2 \notag \\
            &=  4p^2q^4d^2 + 8p^3q^3d^2 + 4p^4q^2d^2 \notag \\
            &=  4p^2q^2d^2 \left( q^2 + 2pq + p^2 \right) \notag \\
            &=  4p^2q^2d^2 
(\#eq:VarDom)
\end{align}
